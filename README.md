# G-and-V Task 

Upon receiving the task I looked at what was going to be my strengths and worked towards those as a starting point to get the most into the project. Although I wasnâ€™t able to finish the full build in the allocated time I am confident I was able to showcase my skillset. I worked from laptop (full screen) to mobile (480px) using Chrome inspect view building in VS code.

Completed:

Accurate design of wireframe with smooth scroll to each section.
Clickable button with pop out active form.
Media queries for mobile devices and hamburger menu.
A static slideshow image.

I wanted to stick to the allotted time to show you my skillset and how I manage my time on a project like this, going forward I would like to implement:

Close contact form when user clicks out of field.
A full working slideshow of all images.
General tweaking of design and interactions of project.
Switch logo when media switches to mobile.
